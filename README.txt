# Tic-Tac-Toe project. 

TheOdinProject path lead me to this awesome project idea. 

## [Live Demo](https://vladius9512.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

### What i learned?

* To commit more often even though i did not commit often enough
* To use factory functions and modules
* Got to practice a little bit with the transitions (on CSS part)
* Testing the product again in the next day (or after a little break) is good at finding bugs


I really enjoyed making this project.
