Tic-Tac-Toe project. 

TheOdinProject path lead me to this awesome project idea. 

What i learned?

-To commit more often even though i did not commit often enough
-To use factory functions and modules
-Got to practice a little bit with the transitions (on CSS part)
-Testing the product again in the next day (or after a little break) is good at finding bugs


I really enjoyed making this project. There are still things to be improved,
making more functions and use them where the code repeats, maybe use a pattern instead of 20 -if-
and an upgrade on the style part, maybe find a way to use the setTimeout too. But 
when i will make it more responsive, it will be a challenge to work on my past code and ill leave it to that moment.
